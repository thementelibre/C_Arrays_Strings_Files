# C (Arrays, Strings, and Files)

## üìö Introduction

My name is **Stefano Caramagno**, and I'm pleased to present this repository containing exercises on **arrays**, **strings**, and **files** implemented in **C programming language**. <br>
These exercises were completed as part of the **Foundations of Computer Science** course during my **Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science and Engineering** at the **University of Catania**.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Array Summation**: Computes the sum of all elements within an array.  
- **Maximum and Minimum Values**: Identifies the largest and smallest elements in an array.  
- **Sorting and Searching**: Implements sorting algorithms and search techniques on arrays.  
- **Removing Duplicates**: Eliminates duplicate values from arrays and stores unique elements.  
- **String Length Calculation**: Determines the length of a string without using standard library functions.  
- **String Reversal**: Reverses the characters of a given string.  
- **Character Frequency Analysis**: Counts occurrences of a specific character in a string.  
- **String Concatenation**: Merges two input strings into a single one.  
- **Upper and Lower Case Conversion**: Converts characters from lowercase to uppercase and vice versa.  
- **File Read and Write Operations**: Reads and writes text files using C file handling functions.  
- **File Copying**: Duplicates the content of one file into another.  
- **Word Count in Files**: Counts the number of words and characters in a text file.  
- **Appending Content to Files**: Adds new content to existing text files without overwriting data.  
- **Character and Line Counting**: Counts the number of characters and lines in a given file.  

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

- **Programming Language**: C for implementing imperative programming principles and algorithm development.
- **Compiler**: GCC (GNU Compiler Collection) for compiling and running C programs.
- **IDE**: Visual Studio Code for development and debugging. 
- **Version Control**: Git for tracking changes and managing project versions.  
- **Repository Hosting**: GitHub for storing, sharing, and maintaining the project repository.  

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following tools installed on your system before proceeding: 

- **GCC (GNU Compiler Collection)**: Required required to compile and run C programs.   
  - **Linux**: Pre-installed or installable via package manager (`sudo apt install gcc`).  
  - **macOS**: Pre-installed or installable via package manager (`brew install gcc`).  
  - **Windows**: Requires MinGW.  
- **IDE**: Required to read and understand code efficiently.  
- **Git**: Used to clone the repository.

### Installation Steps

1. **Clone the Repository**
   
   To download the repository and navigate to its directory:

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/stefanocaramagno/C_Arrays_Strings_Files.git
   cd C_Arrays_Strings_Files
   ```

2. **Choose a Directory**

   To navigate to one of the directories containing the programs (e.g., Exercises 01):

   ```sh
   cd Exercises 01
   ```

3. **Compile the Programs**

   To compile a specific program (e.g., exercise_01.c):

   ```sh
   gcc exercise_01.c -o exercise_01
   ```

### Running the Application

1. **Run the Program**

   To execute the compiled program:

   ```sh
   ./exercise_01
   ```
