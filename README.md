About this project üß≠
This repository collects exercises completed as part of the Foundations of Computer Science course during my Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science and Engineering at the University of Catania. The focus is on C programming, with emphasis on arrays, strings, and basic file operations. The work demonstrates practical problem solving through imperative programming, manual memory management, and straightforward algorithm design. Each exercise centers on a concrete task that blends algorithmic thinking with low-level programming, providing a solid foundation for more advanced topics in software development.

The goal here is not just to show correct results. It is to illustrate the process: how to analyze a problem, devise a plan, translate that plan into C code, test it, and refine it. You will find a mix of small, well-scoped tasks and a few larger challenges that integrate multiple concepts. The approach remains pragmatic: clear code, direct solutions, and transparent reasoning. This repository is meant to be a learning resource as much as a reference for future projects.

Why this repo exists üß©
Foundations of Computer Science courses lay the groundwork for understanding how software works at a fundamental level. Arrays, strings, and file operations are core topics that recur in almost every real-world program. By collecting these exercises in a single place, I aim to:

- Provide a coherent progression from simple to more complex problems.
- Show concrete examples of how to manage memory, handle input/output, and implement basic data processing.
- Create a portfolio piece that demonstrates growth in C programming and problem-solving ability.
- Offer a reference for peers, instructors, or anyone revisiting foundational CS concepts.

The repository also serves as a template for how to organize small, self-contained projects. Each exercise includes a purpose statement, input/output expectations, and a compact solution that students can study and adapt. The emphasis remains on understanding concepts, not on clever hacks. The code sticks to straightforward patterns that are easy to read and reason about.

What you will learn üìö
This collection covers a spectrum of skills that are essential for early careers in software development. Expect to encounter:

- Arrays and pointers in C: allocation, indexing, pointer arithmetic, and careful bounds checking.
- String handling: manipulating C-style strings, concatenation, tokenization, and character processing.
- File operations: opening, reading, writing, seeking, buffering, and error handling.
- Basic data processing: counting, filtering, transforming, and aggregating data.
- Algorithmic thinking: designing steps to solve problems, analyzing time and space trade-offs, and choosing simple, robust methods.
- Debugging techniques: using breakpoints, tests, and trace traces to identify and fix issues.
- Imperative programming style: clear sequences of instructions, loops, conditionals, and direct data manipulation.
- English-language clarity: comments and documentation written with plain English to aid readability.
- Project management habits: repository organization, version control basics, and release-ready packaging.
- Collaboration basics: reading, understanding, and contributing to a public codebase.

How this repo is organized üóÇÔ∏è
The repository follows a clean, predictable layout. Each exercise is a self-contained unit that targets a specific concept or task. You will find:

- A clearly named folder for each exercise or small group of related tasks.
- A short description at the top of each file explaining the goal and required behavior.
- A main.c or similar entry point that demonstrates a minimal, working solution.
- Optional helper modules that isolate functionality and improve readability.
- A simple Makefile or build instructions to compile the code quickly.
- Tests or example runs in a separate section or script when available.

Directory layout ideas you might see in similar projects:
- arrays_basics/
  - main.c
  - tests/
  - README.md
- strings_manipulation/
  - main.c
  - string_utils.c
  - string_utils.h

  - file_io.c
  - file_io.h
- debugging_examples/
  - main.c
  - debug_helpers.c
- misc_exercises/

  - helpers.c

In this repository, you will notice a focus on small, digestible tasks rather than monolithic programs. The intent is to facilitate practice, experiments, and incremental learning. You can read one exercise in about 15‚Äì60 minutes, depending on your pace, before moving to the next. The goals vary, but the common thread is building confidence with core C concepts while reinforcing good programming habits.

Getting started üöÄ
Before you dive in, make sure you have a working C development environment. The exercises are designed to be compiled with common toolchains, such as GCC on Linux or macOS, and with MinGW on Windows. The steps below assume you are starting from a blank workspace.

Prerequisites
- A C compiler: GCC is recommended, but Clang works as well.
- A build tool: Make is optional but helpful for automating builds.
- A text editor or IDE you are comfortable with.
- A basic terminal or command prompt.

Install guidance (high level)
- Linux/macOS: Install build-essential (Ubuntu/Debian) or Xcode command line tools on macOS, plus make.
- Windows: Install MinGW or WSL with GCC, or use an IDE that includes a C toolchain. Install a terminal that supports standard shell commands.

If you want a quick test, try:
- Create a simple program, compile it with gcc -Wall -Wextra -o hello hello.c, and run ./hello.
- If you prefer a Makefile, type make in the exercise directory to build.

Down the road, you may want a more formal setup. You can create a top-level Makefile that builds all exercises, or use CMake if you are more comfortable with it. In this guide, you will see enough recipes to get started without complex tooling.

Build and run üß∞
Compilation is straightforward for most exercises. A typical pattern is:

- Compile a single exercise:
  gcc -Wall -Wextra -O2 -o exercise1 main.c helpers.c

- Build with a Makefile:
  make
  or
  make exercise1

- Run the program:
  ./exercise1

If the repository includes a Makefile or a script, follow those instructions first. They are designed to streamline the process and ensure consistency across exercises.

You will find notes about compilation options in the comments or in the README of each exercise. When in doubt, start with -Wall to enable all warnings and remind yourself to fix careless mistakes. The extra attention to warnings pays back in robust code and a smoother debugging session.

Exercises overview üéØ
This section provides a broad map of the exercises you are about to explore. The topics revolve around arrays, strings, and files, with practical tasks that reinforce memory management, data processing, and interaction with the file system.

Array basics and operations
- Task focus: Practice creating, initializing, and manipulating one- and two-dimensional arrays in C.
- Typical operations: filling arrays with values, computing sums and averages, finding minima and maxima, checking for duplicates, and performing transforms like rotation or reversal.
- Common pitfalls: off-by-one errors, buffer overflows, and incorrect memory usage when dealing with multi-dimensional arrays.

String manipulation and text processing
- Task focus: Work with C-style strings, perform substring searches, tokenization, and safe string operations.
- Typical operations: string copy, concatenation with careful bounds, length checks, and parsing user input.
- Common pitfalls: falling into buffer overflows, forgetting to terminate strings, and incorrect pointer arithmetic leading to undefined behavior.

File operations and I/O
- Task focus: Read and write data to files, process streams, and handle error cases in file I/O.
- Typical operations: open files in read/write modes, read line by line with robust parsing, write results to new files, and manage resources with proper closing and error checks.
- Common pitfalls: not closing file descriptors, ignoring partial reads or writes, and mismanaging file buffers.

Algorithms and problem-solving
- Task focus: Implement elementary algorithms that relate to arrays and strings, such as searches, sorts, and pattern recognition.
- Typical operations: linear search, binary search assumptions, insertion sort, selection sort, and string pattern matching.
- Common pitfalls: failing to maintain invariants, mismanaging indices, and assuming sorted data when it is not.

Debugging and robustness
- Task focus: Introduce deliberate bugs and write tests or checks to uncover them.
- Typical operations: add assert statements, use debugging macros, and create test harnesses to demonstrate correctness.
- Common pitfalls: relying on undefined behavior to ‚Äúfix‚Äù bugs, skipping error checks, and missing edge-case tests.

English-language clarity
- Task focus: Write comments and documentation in clear English.
- Typical operations: describe purposes, inputs, outputs, and edge cases, and provide usage examples.
- Common pitfalls: vague language, ambiguous parameter names, and insufficient error messages.

Design decisions and implementation notes üìù
- Simplicity-first approach: The exercises favor readable, straightforward implementations over clever optimizations.
- Memory safety as a priority: Every allocation is paired with a corresponding free, and boundary checks are performed wherever possible.
- Minimal dependencies: The code avoids external libraries beyond the standard C library to keep exercises portable and easy to audit.
- Clear separation of concerns: Each exercise has its own module(s) with a focused purpose. The main program demonstrates usage without embedding everything in one place.
- Documentation inside code: Every function, structure, and module is explained with comments that are easy to translate into documentation in English.
- Reproducible builds: Build instructions cover common platforms. The Makefile (or alternative build scripts) ensures that the same commands work across environments when possible.

Common pitfalls and how to avoid them
- Off-by-one errors in array indexing: Always keep track of array length and index bounds. Prefer using size_t for counts.
- Memory leaks in dynamic arrays: Pair malloc with free in all paths, including error paths.
- String handling mistakes: Remember C strings require a trailing null terminator. Prefer safety checks and functions like strncmp with explicit lengths.
- File handling errors: Check fopen return values and validate that file operations succeed. Close files in all code paths.
- Undefined behavior: Initialize variables, avoid using uninitialized pointers, and beware of pointer arithmetic that steps outside allocated memory.

Examples and usage scenarios üß™
- Scenario 1: Count the number of occurrences of a character in a string.
  You allocate a string, read input, and loop through each character, incrementing a counter when you see the target character.

- Scenario 2: Read lines from a text file and print words with their frequencies.
  Open the file, read lines, tokenize by spaces or punctuation, and maintain a simple frequency map using parallel arrays or a small hash-like structure.

- Scenario 3: Reverse a string in place.
  Use two indices from the ends of the string, swap characters, and stop when the indices meet.

- Scenario 4: Merge two sorted arrays into a new array.
  Create a new array large enough to hold both input arrays, then merge while preserving order.

- Scenario 5: Find the longest word in a text file.
  Read the file line by line, tokenize into words, and track the maximum length word encountered.

Quality and maintenance checklist
- Code passes simple tests that you can run locally.
- Documentation explains what each exercise does, along with inputs and expected outputs.
- The repository contains a brief contribution guide to help new contributors start quickly.
- The release notes summarize what changed in each release, including notable fixes and enhancements.

Code examples you may encounter
- Basic array operations: initialization, indexing, and simple loops.
- String utilities: stripping trailing newline, safe copy, and tokenization.
- File I/O: opening in read mode, reading with fgets, and closing properly.
- Simple algorithms: linear search, counting occurrences, and basic sorting logic.

Single-responsibility focus
Each exercise targets a specific capability:
- Memory management discipline
- Robust input processing
- Clear output generation
- Predictable behavior in edge cases

This clarity helps you build intuition for how small components come together in larger programs. You can reuse the patterns in other projects, which is a valuable habit for any software developer.

Testing and validation in practice üß™
- Create small harnesses that exercise individual functions with known inputs.
- Write tests that verify output correctness and memory safety.
- Use assertions to check invariants during development, then remove or disable them in production builds if necessary.
- Keep tests lightweight; avoid coupling tests to UI details.

Supporting cross-platform work
- Ensure code does not rely on platform-specific behavior unless necessary.
- Use portable APIs from the C standard library when possible.
- Document any platform-specific caveats in the corresponding exercise README.

Usage notes for readers and students
- Start with the simplest exercise to build confidence.
- Read the exercise goal first, then read the sample input/output to understand the expected behavior.
- Compare your solution to the provided reference to learn about different approaches.
- Comment your code to explain why you chose a particular approach, not only what the code does.
- Use version control to track progress and experiments. A clean commit history helps you reflect on your growth.

Security and safety considerations
- Do not rely on unsafe input for buffer sizes. Always validate inputs.
- Avoid performing memory operations outside allocated regions.
- Be mindful of potential integer overflow when computing indices or sizes.
- If you expose any code publicly, consider adding basic input validation and error handling to prevent misuse.

Changelog and release history
- Each release describes the set of exercises added or updated, notable changes in organization, and any fixes for broken builds or incorrect documentation.
- Release notes help you track progress over time and understand the evolution of the repository.
